# IPv4:

[Internet Protocol](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/ip-internet-protocol) Version 4 is a L3 Network Protocol of 4 Bytes 32 bits Decimal Address which can produce over 4 Billion \(4,294,967,296\) Unique Addresses.

* This 32-bit IPv4 Address is divided into 4 parts called Octets \(each of 1 byte/8 bit\)
* Those bits in each Octet are represented by a number.  Starting from the left they have a value of 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.
* Each bit on the octet can be either 1 or 0. If a Number is 1 then that octet is counted if it is a 0 then it is ignored.
* Just by manipulating 1s & 0s in each octet, we get a range from 0-255.
* **IPv4 Header:**
* It is a connectionless Protocol that offers only best-effort delivery. 
* Each packet is treated differently hence packets may take different paths based on options like Hop Count, Load Balancing, or Bandwidth offered by different Routing Protocols.
* IP has no Data Recovery, No built-in Sessions & No Re-transmission features. Hence, L3 Internet Protocol relies on the L4 TCP which offers all these features & provides guaranteed delivery of Data & packets.
* Routers route packets based on NID & not HID.
* IPv4 Address is divided into [2 parts](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/ipv4-address-parts):
  * Network Port \(NID\)
  * Host Portion \(HID\)
* IPv4 Classfull Addresses were divided into 5 [Classes](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/ipv4-address-classes-1)
