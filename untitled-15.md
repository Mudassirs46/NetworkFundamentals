# IP \(Internet Protocol\)

## TCP-IPNetworkingModel

* HTTP asks for the Web pages from a Web Server, TCP provides guaranteed delivery through Error recovery feature & TCP/IP [Network Layer](untitled-14.md)'s IP provides Addressing for Host identification in the Network using IP Headers  \(encapsulated by Network Layer\) & like Zip codes used in the postal Service IP address groups are used in the Network.
* The main job of IP is Routing \[\[202011241735 IP Routing \(BIG FLOW\)\]\] of IP Packets from Source to Destination.
* * The Total size of an IP Header is 24 Bytes long containing 15 fields.

  **There are 2 versions of IP:**

* \*\*\*\*[**IPv4**](untitled-16.md)
* \*\*\*\*[**IPv6**](untitled-17.md)
