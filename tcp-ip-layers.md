# TCP-IP Layers

TCP/IP Model \[\[202011170203 TCP-IP Networking Model\]\] \(like all the other models\) breaks the functions into small TCP-IP Networking Layers  with each layer describing category of functions which includes Standards & Protocols. 

* **Physical Layer: \[\[202011201529 Physical layer\]\]**
* Focuses on Bits transmission over each individual Link using Protocols like Ethernet, 802.11 \(Wi-Fi\). 

### Data Link-Layer: \[\[202011201526 Data-Link Layer\]\]

* Focuses on sending Data over one type of Physical Link \(E.g. Ethernet, WLAN, etc.\) using Protocols like Ethernet 802.3, 802.11 \(Wi-Fi\) 

### Network Layer: \[\[202011201238 Network Layer\]\]

* Focuses on delivering the Data from the original sending Computer to the final destination Computer using Protocols like IP & ICMP

### Transport Layer: \[\[202011201204 Transport Layer\]\]

* Focuses on the Applications needed for sending & receiving the Data using Protocols like TCP & UDP.

### Application Layer: \[\[202011170304 Application Layer\]\]

* Focuses on the Applications needed for sending & receiving the Data using Protocols like HTTP, POP3, SMTP.
