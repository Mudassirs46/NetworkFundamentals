# TCP-IP Layers

The [TCP/IP Networking Model](untitled-9.md) \(like all the other models\) breaks the functions into small TCP-IP Networking Layers with each layer describing a category of functions which includes Standards & Protocols. 

### **Physical Layer: \[\[202011201529 Physical layers\]\]**

* Focuses on Bits transmission over each individual Link using Protocols like Ethernet, 802.11 \(Wi-Fi\). 

### Data Link-Layer: \[\[202011201526 Data-Link Layer\]\]

* Focuses on sending Data over one type of Physical Link \(E.g. Ethernet, WLAN, etc.\) using Protocols like Ethernet 802.3, 802.11 \(Wi-Fi\) 

### [Network Layer](untitled-14.md):

* Focuses on delivering the Data from the original sending Computer to the final destination Computer using Protocols like IP & ICMP

### [Transport Layer](untitled-13.md):

* Focuses on the Applications needed for sending & receiving the Data using Protocols like TCP & UDP.

### [Application Layer](untitled-11.md):

* Focuses on the Applications needed for sending & receiving the Data using Protocols like HTTP, POP3, SMTP.
