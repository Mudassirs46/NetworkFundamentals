# Full Duplex

The device must not wait before sending a Frame. It can Send at Receive at the same time. \(E.g. Landline Telephone\)

*  **When Full Duplex is enabled it disables CSMA/CD because both can  send & receive at the same time in Full Duplex settings so collisions cannot occur.**
* Ethernet Switch is a dedicated Bandwidth device that supports Full duplex hence it does not share the bandwidth between the devices & provide full 10Mbps connection to each device connected to it.
* On Full Duplex side you will see CRC / RUNT Errors.
* Autonegotiation \[\[202012101226 Autonegotiation\]\] failure leads to Duplex Mismatch \[\[202012110911 Duplex Mismatch\]\]
