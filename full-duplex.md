# Full Duplex

The device must not wait before sending a Frame. It can Send at Receive at the same time. \(E.g. Landline Telephone\)

*  **When Full Duplex is enabled it disables CSMA/CD because both can  send & receive at the same time in Full Duplex settings so collisions cannot occur.**
* Ethernet Switch is a dedicated Bandwidth device that supports Full duplex hence it does not share the bandwidth between the devices & provide full 10Mbps connection to each device connected to it.
* On Full Duplex side you will see CRC / RUNT Errors.
* [Autonegotiation](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/autonegotiation) failure leads to [Duplex Mismatch](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/duplex-mismatch)
