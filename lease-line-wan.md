* One of the types of [WAN](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/wan) is Leased Line WAN.
* The Company using the leased line pays a monthly lease fee to the Telco \(Telephone\) Company who created the leased line by installing a large network of cables and specialized switching devices to create its own computer network.
* To connect two different LANs a Router is placed on each site with each Router connecting one port to its Native LAN & another to the WAN.
* Leased-Line WAN uses a Full-Duplex logic which is connected via 2 Pairs of Wires \(4 Wires\), One Pair for each direction.
* The service acts like a Long crossover cable between two points, but physically A Leased Line is not one long Crossover cable rather it is a Network with multiple devices created by a Telco Company.
* A leased Line is also known as a leased circuit, Circuit, Serial link, Serial line, Point-to-point link, Point-to-point line, T1, WAN link, Link, Private line
