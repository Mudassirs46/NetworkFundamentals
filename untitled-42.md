# Subnetting

Because a [Router](untitled-41.md) routes between the Network hence every port of Router must be in the different Network. No two ports of the Router can belong to the same Subnet.

* If a company has multiple branch offices that are geographically separated if connected is said to be connected on MAN or WAN. 

  On MAN or WAN, we use a Router. 

  And Because Router routes between the Network & not within the Network hence every port of the Router should be in the different Network or Branch offices or Subnet. 

  Hence we use Subnetting.

* **Subnetting Rules:**
  * **Two directly connected devices must be in the same Subnet**

    \(Two IP addresses, not separated from each other by a router, must be in the same subnet\).

  * **Every Port of a Router must be in the different Subnet**

    \(Two IP addresses, separated from each other by at least one router, must be in different subnets\).
