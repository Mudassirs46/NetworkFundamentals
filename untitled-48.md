# Console Cabling

The only Physical option to access the Networking device via the Physical Console port to access the [Cisco OS's CLI](untitled-47.md).

* Console Access requires a Physical connection between the PC & the Physical Console port of the Networking device as well as the software on the PC to transmit Data. 
* **Console Cabling to the Switch is divided into 3 different categories:**
  1. **New PC Connector \(USB Type-A port\) & New Switch Connector \(USB Type Mini-B port\) \(USB Cable\)**
  2. **Old PC Connector \(Serial port DB-9 connector\) & Old Switch Connector \(RJ45 port\) \(Rollover Cable\)**
  3. **New PC Connector \(USB Type-A port\) & Old Switch Connector \(RJ45 port\) \(Converter was used between Rollover & USB Cable\)**

### Pinouts for Rollover Cable \(Old PC DB-9 Serial Port  - Old Switch RJ 45 Port\):

* Rollover Cable uses all the 4 pairs of 8 Wires:
* In the rollover pinout the wire rolls at pin 1 to pin 8, pin 2 to pin 7, pin 3 to pin 6, and so on.
