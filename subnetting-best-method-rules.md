# Subnetting BEST Method Rules

## \(Binary Method + Extra Shortcuts\)

### Subnetting Best Method is Binary Method + Extra Shortcuts which involves stealing /taking away bits from the Host Portion & allocating those stolen bits to the Network portion thereby creating a New Address

## 1. When asked to workout the Number of Hosts per Subnet:

#### Hosts/Subnet = 2^n -2            \(-2 for Subnet & Broadcast Address\)

\(count bits from Right to Left\)

## 2. When asked to workout the Number of Networks:

#### Networks = 2^n

\(count bits from Left to Right\)
