# Cisco CLI

There are various types of Cisco Networking devices \[\[202011231827 Types of Networking Devices\]\] used to connect different Networks using Cisco OS & CLI.

* Just like Windows OS which is the brain of the device where it is installed, Cisco's Operating System \(OS\) is 'Internet Operating System \(IOS\) which controls the Logic & Functions of Networking devices.   
* And Just like Windows OS provides Command Prompt \(CMD\) which is a text based Interface where a user types the command & upon pressing the enter key it commands the Logic of that device which tells the device what to do, Command Line Interface \(CLI\) also does the same work.
* In return the Networking devices send a reply messages in CLI displaying the results.
