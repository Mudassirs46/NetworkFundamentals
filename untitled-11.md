# Application Layer

From amongst the [TCP-IP Layers](untitled-10.md), the fifth layer is the Application Layer.

* The most commonly used Application Layer protocol is HTTP.
* TCP/IP Application Layer provides services between the Computer's Web browser & the Web Server with the help of [HTTP](untitled-12.md).
* HTTP was built to get a  Web page from a Web Server for a Web Browser creating the same layer interaction.
* If however the page is lost in between then Transport Layer's TCP provides us that Mechanism for the re-transmission of the lost pages thereby providing Adjacent Layer interaction.
