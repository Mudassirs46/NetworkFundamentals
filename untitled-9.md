# TCP-IP Networking Model

### One of the Types of [Network Models](untitled-6.md) is the TCP-IP Networking Model.

* DOD \(Department of Defense\) took on the task to create the Second Open vendor-neutral Networking Model for Aiding the competition & Reducing the complexity of what would become known as TCP-IP \(Transmission Control Protocol-Internet Protocol\) Networking Model in 1974.
* Other Networking Model & including the OSI Networking model failed because of a slower formal standardization process & TCP/IP had become a common choice by the end of the 1990s.
* TCP-IP Model both Defines a large collection of protocols using the RFC & it also References them.
* The Vendors that create the Hardware \(like Ethernet/WLAN Card\) & Software \(like OS\) implemented TCP-IP due to which when we turn on any new PC anywhere in the world they all works flawlessly.
* TCP/IP Model \(like all the other models\) breaks the functions into small [TCP-IP Layers](untitled-10.md) with each layer describing a category of functions which includes Standards & Protocols.
