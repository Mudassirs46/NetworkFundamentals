# IPv4 Address Classes

* [IPv4 ](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/ipv4)Classfull  Address is the address with the default mask.
* Classless Address \(CIDR\) is the address with any other mask but not the default mask.
* Classfull Address was used from 1981 until the introduction of Classless Addresses \(CIDR\) in 1993.

  **Classfull Addresses were divided into 5 Classes:**

* **Class A - used for Unicast Traffic**
* **Class B - used for Unicast Traffic**
* **Class C - used for Unicast Traffic**
* **Class D - used for Multicast Traffic**
* **Class E - Reserved for future/experimental purposes.**
* Class A, B & C were used to accommodate different sizes of Networks which aided in the classifications of the Networks.
* Addresses Classes are determined & allocated by the IANA.
