# Transmitting Data over Fiber Optic Cable \(using Hot-Pluggable Transceivers\)

* One of the [Physical Layer Standards](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/physical-layer-standards) defines Fiber Optic Cable Standards.
* There are 2 types of Fiber Modes used in [Fiber Optic ](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/cabling-pinouts-fiber-optic)Cable: Single Mode & Multi-Mode
* Hot-Pluggable Transceivers convert the Optical Signals to Electrical Signals & Vice Versa thereby providing an interface between the Fiber optic & Copper Standards.
* **GBIC \(Gigabit Ethernet Interface Converter\) \(SC Connector\):**
  * It was the original Transceiver used for Gigabit Interfaces. They were bigger in size.
* **SPF \(Small Form Pluggable\) \(LC Connector\):**
  * SPF replaced GBIC as they are smaller in size than GBIC. SPF is also used for Gigabit Interfaces. 
* **SPF+ \(Small Form Pluggable Plus\) \(LC Connector\):**
  * The + Sign means an increased Speed. It is the same size as the SPF but is used for 10-Gbps Interfaces.
