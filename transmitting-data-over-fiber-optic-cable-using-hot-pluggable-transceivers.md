# Transmitting Data over Fiber Optic Cable \(using Hot-Pluggable Transceivers\)

* One of the Physical Layer Standards \[\[202011220920 Physical Layer Standards\]\] define Fiber Optic Cable Standards.
* There are 2 types of Fiber Modes used in Fiber Optic Cable: Single Mode & Multi Mode \[\[202011221801 Cabling Pinouts \(Fiber Optic\)\]\]
* Hot-Pluggable Transceivers convert the Optical Signals to Electrical Signals & Vice Versa thereby providing an interface between the Fiber optic & Copper Standards.
* **GBIC \(Gigabit Ethernet Interface Converter\) \(SC Connector\):**
  * It was the original Transceiver used for Gigabit Interfaces. They were bigger in size.
* **SPF \(Small Form Pluggable\) \(LC Connector\):**
  * SPF replaced GBIC as they are smaller in size than GBIC. SPF is also used for Gigabit Interfaces. 
* **SPF+ \(Small Form Pluggable Plus\) \(LC Connector\):**
  * The + Sign means an increased Speed. It is the Same size as the SPF but is used for 10-Gbps Interfaces.
