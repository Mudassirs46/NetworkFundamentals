# Types of Networking Devices

There are various types of Cisco Networking devices used to connect different [Networks](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/about-this-site) using [Cisco OS](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/cisco-os-ios) & [CLI](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/cisco-cli).

* [Ethernet](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/an-ethernet) was first invented in 1973. And 

  The first Ethernet Cable introduced was **10BASE-5 \(Thicknet Co-axial Cable\) in 1980**. 

  Then followed **10BASE-2 \(Thinnet Co-axial Cable\) in 1985**. And 

  Then finally **10BASE-T \(Twisted Pair Cable\) in 1990** providing the first 10Mbps connection.

* [HUB](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/hub) was the first Ethernet Networking device used before the use of [Switch](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/switch) or a [Router](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/router).

## Model Numbers:

### Switch:

* Cisco 2960-XR Series is the current best fully featured, low-cost Switches for Enterprises in 2020 which supports both the older RJ-45 console port and a USB \(Type Mini-B\) console port.
