# An Ethernet

The Entire family of IEEE LAN Standards \([Physical Layer Standard ](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/physical-layer)& [Data-Link Layer Standard](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/data-link-layer)\) that together define the [Physical Layer ](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/physical-layer)& the [Data-Link Layers ](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/data-link-layer)of the Wired LAN technology is referred to as an Ethernet.

* Ethernet is a Communication Standard that was developed in the early 80s to be used in a LAN \(such as a home/building\) for the Network Computers and other devices. 
* Ethernet uses different Mediums to connect different types of networks which are used in a [SOHO LAN Network](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/a-soho-lan-network) or an [Enterprise Network](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/an-enterprise-lan-network) via different [types of Networking devices](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/types-of-networking-devices).
* Ethernet Address is also called [MAC Address ](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/ethernet-addressing-mac)\(Media Access Control\).
