# An Ethernet

The Entire family of IEEE LAN Standards \[\[202011220920 Physical Layer Standards\]\]  \[\[202011221000 Data-Link Layer Standards\]\] that together define the Physical Layer & the Data-Link Layers of the Wired LAN technology is referred as an Ethernet. \[\[202011201529 Physical layer\]\] \[\[202011201526 Data-Link Layer\]\]

* Ethernet is a Communication Standard that was developed in the early 80s to be used in a LAN \(such as a home/building\) for the Network Computers and other devices. 
* Ethernet uses different Mediums to connect different Types of Network which are used in an SOHO LAN Network \[\[202011211619 SOHO LANs\]\] or an Enterprise Network \[\[202011220802 Enterprise Network\]\] via different types of Networking devices \[\[202011231827 Types of Networking Devices\]\].
* Ethernet Address is also called as MAC Address \(Media Access Control\). \[\[202011231633 Ethernet Addressing \(MAC\)\]\]
