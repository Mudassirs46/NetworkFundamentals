# Cabling Pinouts \(Fiber Optic\)

* For [Transmitting Data over Fiber Optic ](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/transmitting-data-over-fiber-optic-cable-using-hot-pluggable-transceivers)Cable, we use Hot-Pluggable Transceivers.
* An Optical transmitter shines a LED/Laser light in the core which is made up of Fiberglass & is covered with cladding.
* Both Cladding+Core it roughly the size of the diameter of a Human Hair.
* Cladding is further covered with a buffer then a strengthener & finally an Outer Jacket to prevent delicate Fiber Glass from breaking.
* **There are 2 types of Fiber Modes:**
* Single Mode Fiber \(Yellow\)
* Multi-Mode Fiber \(Blue/Red\)

### Single Mode Fiber \(Single angle of Light\) \(Yellow\):

* Provides High Bandwidth at High Speeds over Long distances
* Core's Diameter is 9µm \(Micrometer\)
* Uses Laser
* The Maximum distance Coverage is 550 Meters.

### Multi-Mode Fiber \(Multiple angles of Light\) \(Blue/Red\):

* Provides High Bandwidth at High Speeds over Medium distances
* Core's Diameter is 50µm \(Micrometer\)
* Uses LED
* Maximum distance Coverage is 550M, 10km, 40km ++ .
