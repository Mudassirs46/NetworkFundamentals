# Cabling Pinouts \(Fiber Optic\)

* For Transmitting Data over Fiber Optic Cable we use Hot-Pluggable Transceivers. \[\[202011221126 Transmitting Data \(Fiber Optic\)\]\]
* An Optical transmitter shines a LED/Laser light in the core which is made up of Fiber glass & is covered with cladding.
* Both Cladding+Core it roughly the size of the diameter of a Human Hair.
* Cladding is further covered with buffer then a strengthener & finally an Outer Jacket to prevent delicate Fiber Glass from breaking.
* **There are 2 types of Fiber Modes:**
* Single Mode Fiber \(Yellow\)
* Multi Mode Fiber \(Blue/Red\)

### Single Mode Fiber \(Single angle of Light\) \(Yellow\):

* Provides High Bandwidth at High Speeds over Long distances
* Core's Diameter is 9µm \(Micrometer\)
* Uses Laser
* Maximum distance Coverage is 550 Meters.

### Multi Mode Fiber \(Multiple angles of Light\) \(Blue/Red\):

* Provides High Bandwidth at High Speeds over Medium distances
* Core's Diameter is 50µm \(Micrometer\)
* Uses LED
* Maximum distance Coverage is 550M, 10km, 40km ++ .
