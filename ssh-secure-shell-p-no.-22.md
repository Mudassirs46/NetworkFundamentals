# SSH \(Secure Shell\) \(P No. 22\)

* [Cisco CLI](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/cisco-cli) can be accessed in 3 ways: Console Port, Telnet Access, SSH Access.
* As the name suggests, it is the more secure version of Telnet as all the Data exchange, including login passwords is sent in an [encrypted ](https://app.gitbook.com/@mudassirs46/s/network-fundamentals/~/drafts/-MRZ8l67L5MHnaQIEh9W/securing-user-and-privileged-mode-for-ssh-users)form.
* Just like Telnet, SSH Access also requires software on the PC & an active TCP/IP Connection between the PC & Networking Device to transmit the Data as SSH uses IP Network.
