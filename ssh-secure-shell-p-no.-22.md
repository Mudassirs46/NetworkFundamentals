# SSH \(Secure Shell\) \(P No. 22\)

* Cisco CLI \[\[202012031530 Cisco CLI\]\]  can be accessed in 3 ways: Console Port, Telnet Access, SSH Access.
* As the name suggests, it is the more secure version of Telnet as all the Data exchange, including login passwords is sent in an encrypted form. \[\[202012050657 Securing CLI Modes For SSH Users\]\]
* Just like Telnet, SSH Access also requires software on the PC & an active TCP/IP Connection between the PC & Networking Device to transmit the Data as SSH uses IP Network.
