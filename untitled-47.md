# Cisco OS \(IOS\) & CLI

## IOS

* There are various types of Cisco [Networking devices](untitled-33.md) used to connect different Networks using Cisco OS & CLI.
* Just like Windows OS which is the brain of the device where it is installed, Cisco's Operating System \(OS\) is 'Internet Operating System \(IOS\) that controls the Logic & Functions of Networking devices.   
* And Just like Windows OS provides Command Prompt \(CMD\) which is a text-based Interface where a user types the command & upon pressing the enter key it commands the Logic of that device which tells the device what to do, Command Line Interface \(CLI\) also does the same work.
* In return, the Networking devices send reply messages in CLI displaying the results.
* **Cisco CLI can be accessed in 3 ways:**
  1. **Console:**
     * The only Physical option to access the Networking device via the Physical Console port.
     * Console Access requires the Physical connection between the PC & the Physical Console port of the Networking device as well as the software on the PC to transmit Data. [Console Cabling](untitled-48.md)
  2. **Telnet \(Teletype network\)**
     * Teletype network \(Telnet\) Access requires software on the PC but also an active TCP/IP Connection between the PC & Networking Device to transmit the Data as Telnet uses IP Network. 
  3. **SSH \(Secure Shell\)**
     * As the name suggests, it is the more secure version of Telnet as the Data is sent in an encrypted form.
     * Just like Telnet, SSH Access also requires software on the PC & an active TCP/IP Connection between the PC & the Networking Device to transmit the Data as SSH uses IP Network.
