# Cabling Pinouts \(Ethernet UTP\)

* For Transmitting [Data on UTP](untitled-25.md) \[\[202011221041 Transmitting Data \(Ethernet UTP\)\]\]

  **Pinouts for 10BASE-T and 100BASE-T:**

* 10BASE-T & 100BASE-T both use 2 pairs of 4 Wires:
* To connect two different devices a Straight-through Cable is used but to connect two similar devices Crossover Cable is used.

  **PC, ROUTERS & WAP's Ethernet Interface Transmits on Pin 1&2 and Receives at Pin 3&6**

  whereas 

  **HUB & SWITCH Transmits at Pin 3&6 and Receives on Pin 1&2.**

* But if 2 PCs are connected together then also they both will transmit at Pin 1&2 and receive at Pin 3&6. Hence a Straight-through cable won't work.
* To connect two Similar devices we need a Straight Cable. But to connect two different devices we need a Crossover Cable.
* Crossover cable will now be able to connect two PC together by connecting PC 1's Pin 1-PC2's Pin 3 and lastly PC1's Pin 2-PC2's Pin 6.
* Similarly to connect two Switch together by connecting SW1's Pin3-SW2's Pin1 and lastly SW1's Pin6-SW2's Pin2.

  **Pinouts for 1000BASE-T:**

* 1000BASE-T both uses all the 4 pairs of 8 Wires:
* In 1000BASE-T **CROSSOVER CABLE** Pins 1,2,4&5 Transmits \(TX\) & Pins 3,6,7&8 Receives \(RX\)
