# Data-Link Layer

From amongst the [TCP-IP Layers](untitled-10.md), the Second Layer is the Data-Link Layer.

* HTTP asks for the Web pages from a Web Server, TCP provides guaranteed delivery through Error recovery feature, Network Layer's IP provides Addressing & Routing feature for Intra-Network connectivity & Data Link-Layer's [Ethernet](untitled-20.md) provides Inter-Network Connectivity with the help of Ethernet Headers & Trailers \(encapsulated by Data-Link Layer\). 
* Data-Link Layer uses the same [Data-Link Layer Standard](untitled-24.md) over all these different Physical links \(within that Ethernet LAN\). 
* The most commonly used [LAN Data-Link Layer protocol](untitled-31.md) is **Ethernet** & [WAN Data-Link Layer protocols](untitled-37.md) are High-Level Data Link Control \(**HDLC**\) and Point-to-Point Protocol \(**PPP**\).
