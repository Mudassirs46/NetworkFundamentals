# IP \(Internet Protocol\)

HTTP asks for the Web pages from a Web Server, TCP provides guaranteed delivery through Error recovery feature & TCP/IP Network Layer's \[\[202011201238 Network Layer\]\] IP provides Addressing for Host identification in the Network using IP Headers  \(encapsulated by Network Layer\) & like Zip codes used in the postal Service IP address groups are used in the Network.

* The main job of IP is Routing \[\[202011241735 IP Routing \(BIG FLOW\)\]\] of IP Packets from Source to the Destination.
* * The Total size of an IP Header is 24 Bytes long containing 15 fields.

  **There are 2 Versions of IP:**

* **IPv4 \[\[202011201505 IPv4\]\]**
