# IPv4 Address parts

**IPv4 \[\[202011201505 IPv4\]\] Address is divided into 2 parts:**

* 1. **Network Port**
  2. **Host Portion**

#### 1. Network Portion \(NID\):

* Network Portion also called Network ID \(NID\) is used to identify a specific Network.
* Upon receiving the packet, a Router looks at the DIP & matches the Network Address stored in it's Routing Table.
* Real life  equivalent of NID is a Pin code of an area where only your area code is mentioned but not your read house address

#### Host Portion \(HID\):

* Host Portion also called Host ID \(HID\) is used to identify a specific endpoint \(devices\) on a Network.
* E.g. A PC, SmartPhone, Servers, Printers, etc.
* Real life  equivalent of HID is your House Room Number where your actual House Address is mentioned but not your Pin code.
