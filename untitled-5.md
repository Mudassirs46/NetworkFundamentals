# Internet Standard & Protocols

* IEEE is a Standardization body that reviews the Draft Papers \(of concept Standards/Protocols\) published by the IEEE members & promotes it to an RFC number for further review by the IEEE Engineers then finally given a Standardized Number after being accepted by those Engineers. 

  So an Internet Standard is the Specification of a technology or methodology applicable to the Internet.

* Protocol means 'Set of Rules' & Internet is a Public Network. So an 'Internet Protocol' means, 'A Set of rules which are set by IEEE \(Institute of Electrical & Electronic Engineers\) are to be followed by whoever is willing to use an Internet'.
* So the Internet Standards allow the Manufacturers to make compatible Networking devices whereas the Internet Protocol allows those Networking devices to communicate with each other.
* But due to the sheer numbers of Standards & Protocols made it difficult for the average network engineer to think about and work with networks. Hence [Networking Models](untitled-6.md) were used to reduce the complexity of Engineers.
