* The Entire family of IEEE LAN Standards [Physical Layer Standards](untitled-23.md) [Data-Link Layer Standards](untitled-24.md) that together define the Physical Layer & the Data-Link Layers of the Wired LAN technology is referred to as Ethernet.

* Ethernet is a Communication Standard that was developed in the early 80s to be used in a LAN \(such as a home/building\) for Network Computers and other devices. 
* Ethernet uses different Mediums to connect different types of networks which are used in a [SOHO LAN Network](untitled-21.md) or an [Enterprise Network](untitled-22.md) via different types of Networking devices \[\[202011231827 Types of Networking Devices\]\].
