# 10 to the power of x

## Why we do not add the exponents but multiply it?

* The Addition of another place value of 0-9 numbers leads to the addition of 10 combinations of those 0-9 numbers.

  | Tens Place Value | Ones Place Value |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | 0 | 0 |
  | 1 | 1 |
  | 2 | 2 |
  | 3 | 3 |
  | 4 | 4 |
  | 5 | 5 |
  | 6 | 6 |
  | 7 | 7 |
  | 8 | 8 |
  | 9 | 9 |

* E.g \(0-9\) is a single-digit \(Ones place value. But just by the addition of another digit \(tens place value\) also added the 10 more possibilities of each of those single-digit numbersâ€¦
* Hence it was called Ten place value or \(to the power of 10 as there are 10 possibilities\)

* Notice here there are 10 possibilities of number 1 \(E.g. Numebr 1 can we associated with number 0-9 like 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\). Similarly number 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 & 0 \(each number can be associated with each other  for 10 times.
* Hence it is called Base 10 & 10 to the power of 0-9.
* **BECAUSE THERE ARE NUMBER OF POSSIBLITIES HENCE WE DO NOT ADD BUT MULTIPLY THE EXPONENT.**
