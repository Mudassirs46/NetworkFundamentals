# Number History

**A Network Engineer must know 3 Numbering System:**

* **Decimal \(Base 10\) \(0-9\)**
* **Binary \(Base 2\) \(0-1\)**
* **Hexadecimal \(Base 16\) \(0-15, A-F\)**
* In the olden days, people discovered that counting on sticks would not be efficient hence they invented the Base 10 method \(counting on fingers\) as humans have only 10 fingers.
* This method led to the invention of the Number system 0-9.
* The calculation would look like thisâ€¦

  | Decimal Number |
  | :--- |
  | 0 |
  | 1 |
  | 2 |
  | 3 |
  | 4 |
  | 5 |
  | 6 |
  | 7 |
  | 8 |
  | 9 |

* This even led to the invention of the power \(or exponent\) in the calculation.
* As it is in ones place value hence there can be no other combination. Hence they added another digit \(the tens-place value column to increase the number & the combination\).
