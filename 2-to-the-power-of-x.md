# 2 to the power of x

Binary means dual or double. Those 2 numbers are 1 or 0

* Combination can either be 1-0, 0-1, 0-0, 1-1.
* Because a Binary is just 2 numbers hence it is always calculated in the power of 2.
* E.g. If we have 1 Binary bit that means its \(decimal\) value is 2. If we have 2 binary then we have to calculate 2x2=4 \(which is also called \(22\). If we have 3 binary then it’s Decimal value is \(23\)=2x2x2=8.
* An IP Address \(E.g. 10.0.0.1\) is 4 Byte \(which means 32 bits\) Decimal Address divided into 4 parts \(1 byte for 1 part\) separated by a dot. 
* Each byte is 8 binary bits. Those 8 bits look like this…

| **Binary Value** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** | **1** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Power of 2** | \(2^7\) | 2^6\) | 2^5\) | 2^4\) | 2^3\) | 2^2\) | 2^1\) | 2^0\) |
| **Calculation** | 2x2x2x2x2x2x2x | 2x2x2x2x2x2 | 2x2x2x2x2 | 2x2x2x2 | 2x2x2 | 2x2 | 2 | 1 |

* If However, we add all these bits then it becomes…

   128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1 = 255. That means we have 1-255 IP Addresses in a single octet/byte.
