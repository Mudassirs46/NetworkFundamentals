# Transmitting Data over Ethernet UTP

One of the [Physical Layer Standards](untitled-23.md) defines Twisted Pair Cable Standards.

* To send the Data over a Twisted Pair Cable which uses Copper as a medium, it first creates a circuit between the two nodes using RJ45 Jack.
* There are 8 Wires \(Wt Orange-Orange, Wt Green-Green, Wt Blue-Blue, Wt Brown-Brown\) creating 4 pairs inside a Twisted Pair Cable.
* Each pair \(Wt Orange-Orange\) creates a circuit where one Transmits the current & another receives the current at a time.
* After creating a circuit two nodes follow a rule called Encoding Scheme which converts the Digital Data into a sequence of bits then again to Digital Data.
* Earlier Computers used to follow a 4 bits BCD \(Binary Coded Decimal\) Encoded Scheme which allowed the computers to encode & decode Decimal Numbers only.
* Now Computers follow 16 bits UNICODE \(Universal Code\) Encoding Scheme which enables the computers to encode & decode not only Numbers but also Characters & Symbols as well.
* **PC, ROUTERS & WAP's Ethernet Interface Transmits on Pin 1&2 and Receives at Pin 3&6** whereas **HUB & SWITCH Transmits at Pin 3&6 and Receives on Pin 1&2** [Cabling Pinouts \(Ethernet UTP\)](untitled-27.md)
